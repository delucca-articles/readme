## About this Organization

This organization is dedicated to hosting all source code that I have created to use on my articles. I've decided to organize on this way in order to not mix it up to the code that I was writing for my articles with project code that I write on a daily basis.

Every repository is directly related to only one article. Also, on their `README.md` files would be a link to the original article. Feel free to fork those repositories or copy those codes. If you have any questions about them you can send a message directly to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_odelucca) or through [e-mail](mailto:delucca@pm.me)

There is some code that I've removed recently. If you're searching for something that isn't here anymore please send me an e-mail to delucca@pm.me
